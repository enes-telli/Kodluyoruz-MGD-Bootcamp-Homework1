A simple "Guess The Number" game. The player picks a number between 1 and 1000. The computer guesses until it finds the number the player picked, and when it finds the number, the game is over. When the computer guesses wrong, the user informs the computer with the up or down arrow keys. The computer's guesses are displayed to the user on the UI screen. When the computer makes the correct guess, player presses the P key and the game is over. When the game is over, no input is expected from the player.
